Generic pack of cards library written in Rust. The goals of the library include:

* Various types of decks of cards.
* Internationalization support.
* Ability to create custom sorts for a specific pack of cards.

**UPDATE:** This is a complete rewrite of the library taking advantage of generics
in order to make the code cleaner, and easier to extend. 

## Usage

```rust
use cardpack::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  let mut pack = Standard52::deck();

  pack.shuffle();

  // Deal no-limit hold'em hands for two players:
  let small_blind = pack.draw(2).unwrap().sorted_by_rank();
  let big_blind = pack.draw(2).unwrap().sorted_by_rank();

  println!("small blind: {}", small_blind.to_string());
  println!("big blind:   {}", big_blind.to_string());

  let flop = pack.draw(3).unwrap();
  let turn = pack.draw(1).unwrap();
  let river = pack.draw(1).unwrap();

  println!();
  println!("flop : {}", flop.to_string());
  println!("turn : {}", turn.to_string());
  println!("river: {}", river.to_string());

  // Now, let's validate that the cards when collected back together are a valid Standard52
  // deck of cards.
  let reconstituted_pile =
          Pile::<Standard52>::pile_on(&*vec![pack, small_blind, big_blind, flop, turn, river]);
  assert!(Standard52::deck().same(&reconstituted_pile));
}
```

## Details

The goal of this library is to be able to support the creation of card
decks of various sizes and suits. Out of the box, the library supports:

* [French Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_playing_cards)
  * [Pinochle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochle#Deck)
  * [Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades_(card_game)#General_overview) with [Jokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card))
  * [Standard 52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck)
  * [Canasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canasta#Cards_and_deal)
    * [Hand and Foot](https://www.pagat.com/rummy/handfoot.html)
  * [Euchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre)
* [Short Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-plus_hold_'em)
* [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)#Deck)
* [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot#Tarot_gaming_decks) with [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana) and [Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Arcana) Arcana

The project takes advantage of [Project Fluent](https://www.projectfluent.org/)'s
[Rust](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs) support to offer
internationalization. Current languages supported are
[English](src/fluent/locales/en-US/french-deck.ftl) and
[German](src/fluent/locales/de/french-deck.ftl).

## Responsibilities

* Represent a specific type of card deck.
* Validate that a collection of cards is valid for that type of deck.
* Create a textual representation of a deck that can be serialized and deserialized.
* Shuffle a deck
* Verify that a specific card is playable given a set of discards.

## Examples

The library has several examples programs, including `demo` which shows you the different decks
available.

For the traditional 54 card French Deck with Jokers:

```shell
‚ùØ cargo run --example demo -- --french -v
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.06s
     Running `target/debug/examples/cli --french --verbose`

French Deck:          BüÉü LüÉü A‚ô† K‚ô† Q‚ô† J‚ô† T‚ô† 9‚ô† 8‚ô† 7‚ô† 6‚ô† 5‚ô† 4‚ô† 3‚ô† 2‚ô† A‚ô• K‚ô• Q‚ô• J‚ô• T‚ô• 9‚ô• 8‚ô• 7‚ô• 6‚ô• 5‚ô• 4‚ô• 3‚ô• 2‚ô• A‚ô¶ K‚ô¶ Q‚ô¶ J‚ô¶ T‚ô¶ 9‚ô¶ 8‚ô¶ 7‚ô¶ 6‚ô¶ 5‚ô¶ 4‚ô¶ 3‚ô¶ 2‚ô¶ A‚ô£ K‚ô£ Q‚ô£ J‚ô£ T‚ô£ 9‚ô£ 8‚ô£ 7‚ô£ 6‚ô£ 5‚ô£ 4‚ô£ 3‚ô£ 2‚ô£

Long in English and German:
  Joker Full-Color 
  Joker One-Color 
  Ace of Spades 
  King of Spades 
  Queen of Spades 
  ...
```

Other decks in the demo program are `canasta`, `euchre`, `short`, `pinochle`, `skat`, `spades`,
`standard`, and `tarot`.

Other examples are:

- `cargo run --example bridge` - Prints out a [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) deal.
- `cargo run --example handandfoot` - Shows how to support more than one decks like in the game [Hand and Foot](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hand-and-Foot).
- `cargo run --example poker` - A random heads up [no-limit Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) deal.
