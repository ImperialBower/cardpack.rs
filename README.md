Generic pack of cards library written in Rust. The goals of the library include:

* Various types of decks of cards.
* Internationalization support.
* Ability to create custom sorts for a specific pack of cards.

## Usage

```rust
fn main() {
    let pack = cardpack::Pack::french_deck();

    let mut shuffled = pack.cards().shuffle();
    let sb = shuffled.draw(2).unwrap();
    let bb = shuffled.draw(2).unwrap();

    println!("small blind: {}", sb.by_symbol_index());
    println!("big blind:   {}", bb.by_symbol_index());

    println!();
    println!("flop : {}", shuffled.draw(3).unwrap().by_symbol_index());
    println!("turn : {}", shuffled.draw(1).unwrap().by_symbol_index());
    println!("river: {}", shuffled.draw(1).unwrap().by_symbol_index());
}
```

## Examples

The library has several demo programs in the examples directory.

For the traditional French Deck:

```

`euchre`, `handandfoot` and `tarot` as well as example `poker` and `bridge` hands.

## Details

The goal of this library is to be able to support the creation of card
decks of various sizes and suits. Out of the box, the library supports:

* [French Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_playing_cards)
  * [Pinochle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochle#Deck)
  * [Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades_(card_game)#General_overview) with [Jokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(playing_card))
  * [Standard 52](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck)
  * [Canasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canasta#Cards_and_deal)
    * [Hand and Foot](https://www.pagat.com/rummy/handfoot.html)
  * [Euchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre)
* [Short Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-plus_hold_'em)
* [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)#Deck)
* [Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot#Tarot_gaming_decks) with [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana) and [Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Arcana) Arcana

The project takes advantage of [Project Fluent](https://www.projectfluent.org/)'s
[Rust](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs) support to offer
internationalization. Current languages supported are
[English](src/fluent/locales/en-US/french-deck.ftl) and
[German](src/fluent/locales/de/french-deck.ftl).

## Responsibilities

* Represent a specific type of card deck.
* Validate that a collection of cards is valid for that type of deck.
* Create a textual representation of a deck that can be serialized and deserialized.
* Shuffle a deck
* Verify that a specific card is playable given a set of discards.
* Determine if two deck types are translatable.
