# Playbook bin directory

One all of my development machines, I add `./bin` to my `PATH` environment variable. 
This allows me to run executable scripts in a project's `bin` subdirectory from the root of the project.
Instead if documenting how to do certain steps, I can instead add scripts that not only show
how it works, but also prove it interactively.

TBH, I am still exploring this pattern. While I find it convenient, I am not sure how other
developers will react to it. Luckily, simply deleting the directory is a simple solution to 
any offence.
